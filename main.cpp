FILL/EXPLAIN:
    In the original bkd-tree,
    the oldest nodes are always in the bottom of the tree, but as all trees needs to be read
    during a window search, there is no point in having them sorted. By not having them sorted the task
    of bulkloading multiple trees are also made easier without needing to keep tree order in mind.
    Consider if mediumTree slot is filled with 4 trees which could then be turned into 2 larger trees and then bulkloaded again.
    Instead of these trees beeing bulkloaded twice to keep the original order(explain how with practical example) we could just bulkload
    all 4 together even though this could make it so younger data have a larger tree.
IDEA:
simmulate data by watching how ofthen each thread inserts data blocks!
    -> slipper da og bruke MockAPI thread som sakker ned lÃ¸sningen og krever mer synkronisering!
    -> MockAPI responsible for:
        - setting random timeout between inserts
        - supplying data read by threads



Todo:
- How does thread manager work with Read/Write?
-   -> runs by setting the test workload in MockAPI
- How to implement Read in a smart manner?
-   -> if low workflow use multiple threads to search(?)
-   -> readers have safe structures to read from
-   -> best to have readers only accessing trees(is already a delayed storage, point to slow speeds when accessing arrays)
-   -> only accessing trees will also allow for large array sizes without bottlenecking performance, this is beneficially both for threads and not having to iterate over millions of entries in O(N)

// discussion data age(only read most recent entries(?))


- How does thread manager spot how much work there is?
-   -> How long a given thread uses before it exits after inserting
-   -> Use same measurement to figure out when to start bulkloadings(discussion point)

- Tombstone deletion method with bloomfilters
-   -> bulkloading concurrent system where nodes can quickly set values to deleted
- Reusing memory structures(?)(discussion point, perform tree creation with tree creation with and without memory allocation)


BULKLOADING STRATEGY:
- Lock entire bulkload, if a thread is locked for a long period,
data input is so high that smaller bulkloadings should be performed



Discussion/fill
- Talk about BkdTree beeing made to be thread safe and is just a vessel for threads to work on
- syncronization methods. (atomic defaults to locks if underlying architecture dont support atomic)
- thread workload. (how large must the workload be to overcome startup (talk about gustavsons law))
    -> test with generic example and with BkdTree implementation

// FILL: use struct to don't point direcly at list, can then iterate over without having issues of data changing(?) isj

FILL: test how much overhead is created by spawning thread and thereby how many inserts each thread should perform to be worth spawning
    -> this could be decided by the scheduler(?)

FILL: a sellingpoint in the original BKD tree was the low storage overhead, due to beeing a more complex structure, the concurrent version adds more overhead compared to the original solution

FILL: the implementation could be more efficiend for example all the sorting of every dimension, using a more efficient bulking strategy,
IDEAS:
-   use Type cordinates[DIMENSIONS]



FILL: considered having the last reader delete the struct, but to keep reader performance consistent, this task was assigned to the scheduler
