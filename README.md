# Concurrent-Bkd

Concurrent Bkd-tree is a master's project developed using C++ and Pthreads.

The solution in the `main` branch may not be fully updated.

Test results presented in the Master's thesis can be found in the following test branches:
- `ReadTest`
- `InsertTest1`
- `InsertTestDelayGlobalMemDisk`

The code in the test branches has been updated to address performance bugs that still exist in the code in the `main` branch.

Modifications between the test branches may occur due to different configurations and benchmarking.
