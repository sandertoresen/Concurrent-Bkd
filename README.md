# Concurrent Bkd-tree Insert tests

This branch contains the results of the insert tests conducted without global structures.

## Vtune tests

- **VtuneBenchmarks**: This folder includes the Intel Vtune projects used in the thesis benchmark.

## Scripts

- **benchmarkInsert.sh**: This script is used to run the insert tests on both the laptop and server environments.
- **benchmarkInsertServer.sh**: This script is specifically used to run the insert tests on the server environment.

## Graphs and Results

- **graph[size*tree_size].py**: These files contain the Pyplot figures based on the inserter results.
- **serverResults.py**: This file also includes the Pyplot figures generated from the server test results.
- **resultInsert.txt**: This file contains the raw printout of the insert results generated by the `.sh` tests.
- **serverResults.txt**: This file contains additional raw results generated by the server `.sh` tests.

## Configuration

The configuration for the tests has been modified between each run. The `THREAD_BUFFER_SIZE` was set to `[Num]*4096`, where `[NUM]` represents the size specified in `[NUM]x[treesize]` as mentioned in the result and test files. The `[treesize]` indicates the number of trees generated for a given test.
